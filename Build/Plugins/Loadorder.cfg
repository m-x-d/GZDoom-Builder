// This file allows you to enforce the order in which plugins are loaded.
// This may be important for some plugins as they require their functions to
// be called before or after those of others.
//
// Simply list the filenames here in the order they should be loaded. Any files
// in this directory that are not on this list will be loaded last.
//
// Example:
//
// loadorder
// {
//     BuilderModes.dll;
//     ZDoomEditing.dll;
//     FancyFlatFlipper.dll;
// }
//

loadorder
{
	BuilderModes.dll;
