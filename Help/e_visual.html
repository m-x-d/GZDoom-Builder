		The Visual Mode is different from the other modes. In this mode you can walk and fly through your map in 3D and see it as it would look like in game. With the crosshair you can aim at objects (floors, ceilings, walls and things) and edit them instantly. You can also select objects and perform actions on all objects together. Note that not all actions apply to an entire selection.

			<td valign="top"><b title="Left Mouse Button">LMB</b></td>
			<td>Select the targeted object. For walls, hold down this button to drag the texture offsets.</td>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b title="Shift + Middle Mouse Button">Shift+MMB</b></td>
			<td>Flood-fills with the copied texture image or flat image onto the target. This fills all adjacent textures or flats that are identical to the original. Note that this action is only applied to the targeted object and does not work for a selection.</td>
