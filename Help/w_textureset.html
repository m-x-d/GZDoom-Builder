		This dialog window lets you make your own Texture Set. On the top of this window you can enter the name of the Texture Set, this is how it will be displayed in the <a href="w_gameconfigurations.html">Game Configurations Window</a> and the <a href="w_imagesbrowser.html">Image Browser Window</a>. It is recommended that you make your Texture Sets while the map you are editing is open in Doom Builder, so that you can see the results immediately.
		
		<h2>Filters</h2>
		In this area you set up what you want to include in this Texture Set. You can use wildcards to include more than one texture at once. Use the question mark <b>?</b> to indicate exactly one character (no matter which character) and use the asterisk <b>*</b> to indicate zero or more characters (no matter which characters). Each Texture Set has its own filters, so it is possible for Texture Sets to overlap and include textures that are also in other Texture Sets.
		
		<h2>Results</h2>
		If you have a map open in Doom Builder while you are setting up your Texture Sets, you can instantly see the result in the Results area. By clicking the buttons <b>Show Matches</b> and <b>Show Not Matching</b> you can see which textures are included and which are not. When viewing the texture that are <b>not</b> included, you can double-click the texture image to add it to the filters list and include it in the Texture Set.
