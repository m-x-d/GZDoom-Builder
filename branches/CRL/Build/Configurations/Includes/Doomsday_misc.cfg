MAP LUMP NAMES
Map lumps are loaded with the map as long as they are right after each other. When the editor
meets a lump which is not defined in this list it will ignore the map if not satisfied.
The order of items defines the order in which lumps will be written to WAD file on save.
To indicate the map header lump, use ~MAP

Legenda:
required = Lump is required to exist.
blindcopy = Lump will be copied along with the map blindly. (usefull for lumps Doom Builder doesn't use)
nodebuild = The nodebuilder generates this lump.
allowempty = The nodebuilder is allowed to leave this lump empty.
script = This lump is a text-based script. Specify the filename of the script configuration to use.
