    <p><strong>Q:</strong> I'm getting a ton of &quot;<strong>Unable to find the DECORATE class '[some actor]' to inherit from, while parsing '[some other actor]:[DoomEdNum]'</strong>&quot; warnings. What's wrong?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> This happens when a DECORATE actor is inherited from another actor, which is not defined in game configuration. To fix this, add "<strong>(g)zdoom.pk3</strong>" as a map resource. Don't forget to check "Exclude from testing parameters" chekbox while adding it, otherwise (G)ZDoom won't load. (g)zdoom.pk3 can be found in (G)ZDoom folder.    </p>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> I'm getting a ton of &quot;<strong>Error in 'GLDEFS' at line [n]: light declaration not found for light '[light name]'</strong>&quot; warnings. What's wrong?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> GZDoom Builder doesn't include GLDEFS lights definitions. To get rid of these errors, add &quot;<strong>lights.pk3</strong>&quot; as a map resource. Don't forget to check &quot;Exclude from testing parameters&quot; chekbox while adding it, otherwise GZDoom won't load. lights.pk3 can be found in GZDoom folder. </p>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> When I create a new map, I see only Doom-related game configurations. Where are configurations for other games?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> Copy &quot;<span class="style1">[EngineName]_[Game][MapType].cfg</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="style1">Includes</span>&quot; folder from   &quot;<span class="style1">[GZDB]\Configurations\Configs for other games\[Game]</span>&quot; to   &quot;<span class="style1">[GZDoom Builder]\Configurations\</span>&quot;.<br />
      If you are using Zandronum, you'll also need to copy all files from &quot;<span class="style1">[GZDB]\Configurations\Configs for other games\Zandronum Includes\</span>&quot; to the main &quot;<span class="style1">Includes</span>&quot; folder (&quot;<span class="style1">[GZDB]\Configurations\Includes\</span>&quot;) .</p>
