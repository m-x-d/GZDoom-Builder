=== DOOM BUILDER 2 PLUGIN (CopyPasteSectorProps) ==============================
File: CopyPasteSectorProps.dll
Author: Boris Iwanski
Version: 1.0.0.0
Minimum DB2 Version: 2.0.1.1157


=== What does it do ===========================================================
This plugin copies the properties (floor/ceiling heights, floor/ceiling
textures, brightness, tag and special effect from a sector and pastes
them to one or more sectors. Unlike the join/merge sector function this
plugin does not change the sector references of the sidedefs.


=== Usage =====================================================================
Menu entry: no
Toolbar buttons: no
Hotkeys: yes. There are two new actions in the "Sectors" section of the
	controls. They are called "Copy sector properties" and "Paste sector
	properties".

IMPORTANT: you'll have to assign hotkeys to those actions to use the
functionality of this plugin!

To copy the properties of a sector just highlight the desired sector (hover the
mouse over it) and press the hotkey you assigned to "Copy sector properties".
Now you have two ways to paste those properties to other sectors. Either you
highlight a sector and press your "Paste sector properties" hotkey or select
(by clicking) multiple sectors and then press you "Paste sector properties"
hotkey to paste the properties to all of them.
