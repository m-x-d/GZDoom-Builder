// it is recommended to do so in your own file as this file will be updated each release.

// NOTE: Nodebuilder configuration key names defined here must be unique for all nodebuilders!
// Recommend to start the key name with the name of the compiler, followed by underscore and a specific name.

// The "compiler" setting must refer to an existing compiler (such as defined above), but it
// does not have to be a compiler defined in the same configuration file.

// Parameter placeholders:
// %F is the WAD file where the nodebuilder must read from
// %T is the WAD file to which the nodebuilde writes its output (optional)
// When %T is not specified, the nodebuilder should output to %F
