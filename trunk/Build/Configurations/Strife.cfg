TEXTURES AND FLAT SOURCES
This tells Doom Builder where to find the information for textures
and flats in the IWAD file, Addition WAD file and Map WAD file.

Start and end lumps must be given in a structure (of which the
key name doesnt matter) and any textures or flats in between them
are loaded in either the textures category or flats category.

For textures: PNAMES, TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 are loaded by default.

TEXTURES AND FLATS FILTERING
This allows you to filter textures and flats so that you only see the
textures/flats listed that you prefer to use.

The key name doesnt matter here, only the values. You can use
the following wildcards in values to specify ranges:

? = Any character
* = Zero or more characters
# = Any numeric digit
[abc...] = Any of these characters that are between brackets
[!abc..] = Not any of these characters that are between brackets

MAP LUMP NAMES
Map lumps are loaded with the map as long as they are right after each other. When the editor
meets a lump which is not defined in this list it will ignore the map if not satisfied.
The order of items defines the order in which lumps will be written to WAD file on save.
To indicate the map header lump, use ~MAP

Legenda:
required = Lump is required to exist.
blindcopy = Lump will be copied along with the map blindly. (usefull for lumps Doom Builder doesn't use)
nodebuild = The nodebuilder generates this lump.
