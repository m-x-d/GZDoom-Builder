Doom Builder 2 command-line arguments
======================================

Usage:

   builder.exe [wadfile] [-map mapname] [-cfg configname]


Parameters:

- wadfile
This is a .WAD file to load immediately after Doom Builder has started up. Unless -map
and -cfg are used, this will show the map-options dialog.

- map
Where 'mapname' is the name of the map (map header lump name) such as MAP01 or E1M1. When
specified, this will indicate the map to load from the specified wad file. Use in
combination with -cfg to provide the required information to skip the map-options dialog.

- cfg
Where 'configname' is a game configuration filename, for example, "ZDoom_DoomHexen.cfg".
When used in combination with -map this will provide the required information to load a
map directly and skip the map-options dialog.
