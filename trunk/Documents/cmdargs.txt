Doom Builder 2 command-line arguments
==========================================================================================

Usage:

   builder.exe [wadfile] [-map mapname] [-cfg configname] [-delaywindow] [-nopreferences]

==========================================================================================

Parameters:

- wadfile
This is a .WAD file to load immediately after Doom Builder has started up. Unless -map
and -cfg are used, this will show the map-options dialog.

- map
Where 'mapname' is the name of the map (map header lump name) such as MAP01 or E1M1. When
specified, this will indicate the map to load from the specified wad file. Use in
combination with -cfg to provide the required information to skip the map-options dialog.

- cfg
Where 'configname' is a game configuration filename, for example, "ZDoom_DoomHexen.cfg".
Do NOT include the path, all game configurations must be in the Configurations subfolder.
When used in combination with -map this will provide the required information to load a
map directly and skip the map-options dialog.

- delaywindow
This delays showing the main interface window until the automatic map loading from
command line parameters is completed, and the program is not terminating yet. This is
usefull for plugins that can be used to perform batch processes where the showing of the
main interface window is not desired. If a plugin completes it's actions on map load and
terminates the application immediately, the main window will not be shown at all.

- nosettings
When this parameter is specified, Doom Builder will not load your preferences or game
configuration settings and will use the default settings instead. You will not lose your
original settings, but when this parameter is specified your settings will not be saved.

Examples:

This loads the file "Ubermegawad.wad" after Doom Builder is initialized and shows the
map-options dialog:

   builder.exe "C:\Games\Doom\My Maps\Ubermegawad.wad"

This loads the file "Ubermegawad.wad" after Doom Builder is initialized and shows the
map MAP23 with the game configuration for Doom 2:

   builder.exe "C:\Games\Doom\My Maps\Ubermegawad.wad" -map MAP23 -cfg "Doom2.cfg"
