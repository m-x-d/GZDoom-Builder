
This describes the various compiler interfaces available. These can be used with
the "interface" setting in a compiler configuration. Plugins can create their
own interfaces by inheriting from the abstract Compiler class.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AccCompiler

This compiler interface is made for Acc compilers, but can be used for any compiler
which accepts a single script input file and writes a single output file.

If this interface detects a file named "acs.err" created by the compiler, it will
parse this file and treat the contents as compiler errors. In this case, the output
file contents are not copied into the wad file.

With this interface you can use the following command-line parameters:

%FI indicates the input path and filename.

%FO indicates the output path and filename.

%PI indicates the path of the input file (without filename).

%PO indicates the path of the output file (without filename).

%PT indicates the temporary directory path where the compiler is located.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NodesCompiler

This compiler interface is made for nodebuilders.

With this interface you can use the following command-line parameters:

%FI indicates the input filename (no path included).

%FO indicates the output filename (no path included).

%PT indicates the temporary directory path where the compiler and input/output files
are located. This is also the working directory for the compiler.
