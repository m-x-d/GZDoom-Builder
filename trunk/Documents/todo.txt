There are no dates in this planning because I value
quality over quantity. It is done when it's done.
The order and included items may also change any time.
=========================================================

- Offsets in info panel are not updated when dragging textue or changing texture offsets.

- Full brightness option in Visual Mode

- Info panel should be collapsable

- Create menus for different modes

- Create gradient ceiling/floor heights feature

- Fix flats alignment in Visual Mode (possibly also in Classic Modes)

- Fix flat texture coordinates in Classic Modes (some flats/textures on floors appear stretched or shrinked)

- Right-click in empty space in Linedefs mode does weird.

- Edit Selection mode does not take size of things into account.

- Set up forum for bug reports and development.

- Test map nomonsters option in same menu
