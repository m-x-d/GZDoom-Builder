FEATURE SUGGESTIONS
----------------------------------------

ForcePallete
	Forces the texture/patch to be restricted to the game
	pallete. Useful for blends that look good in software,
	but turn out really bad in GL.

----------------------------------------
Bugs with TEXTURES definitions:
----------------------------------------
* The Desaturate translation does nothing.

!* Desaturate requires parenthesis or else ZDoom will crash.

=* There is an additional required number for Desaturate that
	has no effect.
	
=* 0-255 Integer RGB values for Blend are read as hexadecimal
	when the list is enclosed in quotation marks.
	
!* Integer values 100-249 cause ZDoom to crash when used.
	This is possibly related to the hexadecimal bug above.
	This only affects the Red value, when the list is surr-
	ounded by quotes.
	
!* Integer values 6-36 cause ZDoom to crash when used in a
	Blend statement. This only applies to a list that is not
	surrounded by quotes, and only the Red value.
	
* Hexadecimal values load as a single string ("8080FF"), but
	are not displayed properly.
	
=* Named translations do not respect patch transparency.
	This bug manifests itself differently in ZDoom than in
	GZDoom. In GZ, it happens all the time. In ZD, it only
	occurs when the patch interacts with a patch with a
	Style value other than Copy.

=* Blends also do not respect patch transparency.

!* Using out-of-range pallete indexes in translations causes
	ZDoom to crash.

---------------------------------------	
Functioning Styles:
---------------------------------------
Add
	Functions completely as expected.

Subtract
	Inverts patch, Applies Multiply? Blend on Patch

ReverseSubtract
	Inverts underlying image, Applies Multiply? on Patch
	
*	Lower Alpha values make the overall result darker, for
	  some reason.

Modulate
*?	Unaffected by Alpha. Algorithm unknown.

---------------------------------------
Broken Styles:
---------------------------------------
Copy
	Appears to do nothing, even with 0.5 Alpha

CopyAlpha
	Alpha does nothing. In software mode, seems to cause
	  some kind of color distortion. Looks exactly like Copy
	  when in GZDoom GL mode. (GZ r248)
	CopyAlpha also triggers the transparency bug with
	  translations

Blend
	Bad syntax error

---------------------------------------
Other:
---------------------------------------
Multiple translations must be induvidually quoted
	( "a:b=x:y", "e:h=l:o" ) in order to function properly.
	
Styles do not affect other world textures. All styled
	Patches are automatically blended against black if there
	is no underlying image data.
